#CargoTrace Finance

**A Decentralized Trade Finance System for Real-World Trade**

CargoTrace Finance is a blockchain-powered platform that connects **global trade document flows** with **decentralized finance (DeFi)**. It’s built to solve a critical gap in the import/export process — enabling traders to **secure instant funding** based on verified customs documents, without relying on traditional banks or centralized platforms.

## The Idea

Many importers/exporters in Egypt and the MENA region face delays and cash flow issues due to slow customs clearance and lack of accessible financing. Meanwhile, platforms like **CargoX** handle digital document flows on Ethereum — but offer no financial layer.

**CargoTrace bridges this gap.**  
It **monitors CargoX documents** on Ethereum, mirrors them as NFTs on the Internet Computer (ICP), and **triggers automated loans** using ICRC-1 tokens when valid customs documents are detected.

## Key Features

- **Document Tracking:** Monitors CargoX document transfers via Ethereum RPC and Etherscan  
- **Customs Matching:** Verifies document links to Egyptian customs (ACID / NAFEZA)  
- **NFT Mirroring:** Mints mirrored NFTs on ICP as proof of verified documents  
- **On-Chain Lending:** Triggers lending logic via ICP smart contracts using stable tokens  
- **Cross-Chain Logic:** Connects Ethereum → ICP without needing third-party bridges

---

## How It Works (Simplified)

1. A trade document (e.g. bill of lading) is issued on **CargoX (Ethereum)**  
2. Our **Ethereum Listener** detects the transfer and stores metadata  
3. The user (trader) confirms the customs ACID code via our frontend  
4. If matched, an **NFT is minted on ICP** as a mirrored proof  
5. ICP Smart Contract **automatically issues a stable loan** to the trader

## Impact

- Enables **trustless financing** for import/export  
- Reduces risk of fraud or manual errors  
- Promotes **DeFi adoption in real-world infrastructure**
